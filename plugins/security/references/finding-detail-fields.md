# Rich Finding Detail Fields

For every reportable finding in `findings.json`, preserve the validated reasoning and the exact source snippets that prove it. Downstream consumers render these fields directly; nothing recovers missing analysis from `report.md` or reads source files after the scan.

## Writing Rules

- Wrap RPC names, functions, types, fields, parameters, configuration keys, literal identifiers, and short expressions in single backticks. For example: `POST /archives`, `member.name`, `dest_root`, and `extract_archive()`.
- Keep code out of prose. Put source snippets in `codeEvidence[].code`, then reference them from the section that explains why the snippet matters. Consumers consolidate those referenced snippets under **Root cause** so the violated invariant and its source proof stay together.
- Root cause must be a source-backed walkthrough, not a verdict paragraph. Start with the code where user-controlled data is declared, decoded, or read; follow each meaningful call, transformation, or state transition; then show the missing control, dangerous operation, and later consumer when it affects impact.
- Give each code-evidence item a stable `id`, a concise `label`, an exact source location, the smallest useful snippet, a `role`, and an `explanation`. Supported roles include `user_input`, `entrypoint`, `propagation`, `root_control`, `sink`, `outcome`, and `expected_control`.
- Write each `explanation` as connective reasoning: identify the attacker-controlled value at this step, say which callee or state receives it next, and explain why the shown lines preserve or violate the expected invariant.
- Order `rootCause.evidenceRefs` from user input to outcome. Put an `expected_control` comparison after the vulnerable call-stack refs; it is supporting context, not a step in the vulnerable stack. Omit incidental helpers that do not carry the value or enforce the relevant boundary.
- Do not use location-only filler such as "the root cause is tied to the broken control at path:line." The source table already records locations. Explain the violated invariant and show the code that violates it.
- Validation must connect attacker-controlled input, the missing or bypassed control, and the security-relevant state change or sink. Do not replace that proof with a list of file names and line numbers.
- Attack-path analysis must be concise. Record the realistic attacker boundary, the minimum trigger sequence, and the concrete outcome. Use code evidence for the important transitions instead of repeating the full validation narrative.
- Populate only evidence-backed fields. Omit unknown values instead of adding placeholders.

## Concise Finding Projection

The finding detail view is a decision-focused projection of the canonical finding, not a copy of the full `vulnerability-writeup` report. Preserve the parts of that report that a reviewer needs to understand and act on the issue:

- the validation method, direct observations, confidence rationale, and remaining uncertainty;
- dataflow source, meaningful transformations, dangerous sink, and concrete outcome;
- realistic attacker, entry point, access requirements, preconditions, and attacker outcome;
- severity rationale plus the specific evidence that would raise or lower the rating;
- the minimal remediation invariant, regression tests, and preventive controls.

Keep background exposition, alternate exploit research, full PoC instructions, representative command output, and long source walkthroughs in the detailed write-up. Do not copy them into canonical fields merely to make the finding longer. The finding should stay self-contained enough to support triage while avoiding duplicated or speculative prose.

Treat recorded artifacts as a navigator, not another source-proof section. When `writeup.reportPath` is present, it names a verified scan-local report whose sibling `poc/` directory holds the supporting regular files. Do not place artifact paths in root-cause prose or add an unvalidated artifact list to the canonical finding merely for display.

## Structured Example

The following shape shows how to encode the archive-extraction path-traversal finding from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/examples/completed-scan/`:

```json
{
  "summary": "The `POST /archives` upload handler passes the uploaded archive to `extract_archive()`, which joins each attacker-controlled `member.name` onto `dest_root` and writes without a containment check, so a member named `../../etc/cron.d/job` escapes the extraction root.",

```

`rootCause.code` and `rootCause.language` remain supported for older producers that can provide only one snippet. New producers should use the shared `codeEvidence` catalog, assign call-stack roles, and order `rootCause.evidenceRefs` from input to outcome so the same exact source can support Root Cause, Validation, and Attack-path analysis without copying it into several fields.
